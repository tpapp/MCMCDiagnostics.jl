    autocorrelation(x, k, v = var(x))

of `x`, used when supplied.

"""
    ess_factor_estimate(x, v = var(x))

Estimate for effective sample size factor.

Return `τ, K` where `τ` is estimated effective sample size / sample size, and
`K` is the last lag used for autocorrelation estimation.

# Notes

See Gelman et al (2013), section 11.4.

`τ` is capped at 1, this is relevant when the sample has large negative
autocorrelation (happens with HMC/NUTS).

Some implementations (eg Stan) use FFT for autocorrelations, which yields the
whole spectrum. In practice, a <50-100 lags are usually sufficient for
reasonable samplers, so the “naive” version may be more efficient.

"""
    effective_sample_size(x, v = var(x))

Effective sample size of vector `x`.

Estimated from autocorrelations. See Gelman et al (2013), section 11.4.

When the variance `v` is supplied, it saves some calculation time.

"""
    potential_scale_reduction(chains...)

Potential scale reduction factor (for possibly ragged chains).

Also known as R̂. Always ≥ 1 by construction, but values much larger than 1 (say
1.05) indicate poor mixing.

Uses formula from Stan Development Team (2017), section 28.3.
